# Y - Upload Your Images and Share Them

### Assumptions for this Project:
- There can be a lot of Data an maybe in the feature users and additional Data ,and this is why it connected to a mongoDB and not saving the image Metadata in jsonfile or similar approch
- Since it need to go directly to production I decided to use Material UI as my base styling design system. so it will be easier to match every component and design in the project
- The backend controls the process of deleteing images (and thetsting of this process)
